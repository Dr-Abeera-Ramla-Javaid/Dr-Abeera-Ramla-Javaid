* 👋 Hi, I'm Dr. Abeera Ramla Javaid (@Dr-Abeera-Ramla-Javaid)
  
* 👀 I'm passionate about using artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics, building full-stack applications, and creating innovative platforms
   
* 🌱 Right now, I'm learning how to use Chainlit to build smart chatbots, and I'm also improving my skills in Next.js and TypeScript to develop advanced AI projects.
  
* 💞️ I'm interested in working with others on projects that use AI in healthcare, education, and modern e-commerce systems.
  
* 📫 You can reach me at [dr.arjavaid701.pk@gmail.com](mailto:dr.arjavaid701.pk@gmail.com) for any questions or collaborations.
  
* ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a doctor and an engineer who also codes, and I'm balancing all of this while continuing my academic journey! 😎
